# Connect-Four-GUI-
Connect Four game made with TKInter GUI

The three image files are needed to load the board and player turn images for the GUI. Make sure to have them in the same folder as the python main file.

Built with Python 3.6

Also uses PIL library so that can be downloaded separately if you don't have it.

I am planning to update this later with some optimizations for graphics as well as a computer player option.
Feel free to use this for your own project, or to give me your thoughts on development options, coding options, or any bugs you might have encountered using it.
